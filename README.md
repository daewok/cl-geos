# CL-GEOS #

This is a Common Lisp interface to the [GEOS](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/)
library for performing geometric functions.

This library is still beta quality, but every effort will be made to preserve
the external API when bumping up to version 1.0.

# Prerequisites #

Requires the GEOS library. On Debian based systems, this can be accomplished by
running:

    apt-get install libgeos-dev
